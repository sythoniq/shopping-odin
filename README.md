> **Project Takeaways**

>> *React Routers*

 > - Gained some insight into how react routers work, by routing three different
 >   pages together
    
 > - Introduced to the concept of context and how it can be utilized, and this
 >   in this project, it allowed me to lift state to the `Root.jsx` route for
 >   all my other routes to have access to

 > - Learnt more about try and catch blocks and how I can use them in
 >   asynchronous actions, they are pretty handy to handle state in edge cases

>> *Some Bits Of CSS*

 > - Added some animations to an element for the first time today, by getting
 >   insights from [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com) in making a loader. As
 >   well as making a small animation to the gif in the home

 > - Learnt about handling of overflow when it comes to texts with things like
 >   `ellipsis` to hide extra text to preserve space

>> *TO-DO*

 > - A collection of some of the bits that are remaining and would be ideal to
 >   get done.

 >> - Adding some testing to the entire project using vitest. Though I do need
 >>   to read up on this soon.

 >> - Maybe redo the styling for it to be much more user friendly by considering
 >>   color contrast and responsiveness or different devices as well as font
 >>   size if need be.
    
 >> - Forgot to add a cart item counter, will implement really soon.
